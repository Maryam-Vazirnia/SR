# Rymbolic Regression
This is my first code for algorithm genetics Which is using the gplearn library

There are two text files here
One is **data** and one is **matrix**. The first is related to the data of supernovae ( redshifts ), and the second is to the  covariance matrix
I have not yet been able to find a way to calculate the quantitative error in this code
